# Setup

## How to install as an extension
Clone the repository, then go to `chrome://extensions`.

Enable the developer mode, then click Load Unpacked. Select the repository's directory and hit select.

The extension should now be loaded. 

## How to add an account
To add an account, click the extension's icon in the chrome bar.
